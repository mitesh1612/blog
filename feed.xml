As I always says, the solution seems trivial, and you might already know something on the lines of it, but it took me a good amount of researching and experimenting to get it to work, so I thought I should share it.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to have Multiple Custom Script Extensions for Azure Virtual Machines in One ARM Template Deployment</title><link href="https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/05/14/vms-with-multiple-extensions" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to have Multiple Custom Script Extensions for Azure Virtual Machines in One ARM Template Deployment" /><published>2021-05-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-05-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/05/14/vms-with-multiple-extensions</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Azure" /><category term="ARM" /><category term="VM" /><summary type="html">Yes, I’m back with yet another Azure specific problem, but judging from the number of issues this problem is mentioned in, and the lack of solutions for it, I thought this solution is worth sharing more. I will not go over the concepts of Azure Virtual Machines or the Custom Script Extensions for Azure Virtual Machines. Microsoft gives a pretty great documentation for those, which you can read here.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to deploy Azure Blob Container with files using ARM templates</title><link href="https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/03/26/storage-container-with-files" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to deploy Azure Blob Container with files using ARM templates" /><published>2021-03-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-03-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/03/26/storage-container-with-files</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Azure" /><category term="ARM" /><category term="ADLS" /><summary type="html">I know, I know, this is a really specific problem. But one that I encountered, and when I Googled/Bing’d it, I was not able to find any way to do it. I was able to fix it, and you might too, but I thought I should use my blog to share how I solved it, hoping it might come in handy who wants to achieve something similar. If you have alternate or downright better ways to do it, please feel free to add them in comments.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello Xamarin (And 2021)</title><link href="https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/01/16/welcome-xamarin" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello Xamarin (And 2021)" /><published>2021-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/01/16/welcome-xamarin</id><author><name></name></author><category term="C#" /><category term="xamarin" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Hey there. So I planned to do this, at least not 15 days later into the year. 2020 has been a mess of an year and eventhough, on the surface, the start might not be awesome, I have better hopes and goals for 2021. One of these goals is to write even more in this blog (considering I’ve written, what like 6 posts in 5 months?). We will see how that pans out in the future, but here is one update that I’d like to share, and the topic you might see future posts on.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Blog Update 1</title><link href="https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2020/12/24/blog-update-1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blog Update 1" /><published>2020-12-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-12-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2020/12/24/blog-update-1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="blog" /><category term="about" /><summary type="html">Hey there.
