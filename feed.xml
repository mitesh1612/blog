As I always says, the solution seems trivial, and you might already know something on the lines of it, but it took me a good amount of researching and experimenting to get it to work, so I thought I should share it.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to have Multiple Custom Script Extensions for Azure Virtual Machines in One ARM Template Deployment</title><link href="https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/05/14/vms-with-multiple-extensions" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to have Multiple Custom Script Extensions for Azure Virtual Machines in One ARM Template Deployment" /><published>2021-05-14T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-05-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/05/14/vms-with-multiple-extensions</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Azure" /><category term="ARM" /><category term="VM" /><summary type="html">Yes, I’m back with yet another Azure specific problem, but judging from the number of issues this problem is mentioned in, and the lack of solutions for it, I thought this solution is worth sharing more. I will not go over the concepts of Azure Virtual Machines or the Custom Script Extensions for Azure Virtual Machines. Microsoft gives a pretty great documentation for those, which you can read here.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to deploy Azure Blob Container with files using ARM templates</title><link href="https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/03/26/storage-container-with-files" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to deploy Azure Blob Container with files using ARM templates" /><published>2021-03-26T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2021-03-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/03/26/storage-container-with-files</id><author><name></name></author><category term="Azure" /><category term="ARM" /><category term="ADLS" /><summary type="html">I know, I know, this is a really specific problem.

If you have alternate or downright better ways to do it, please feel free to add them in comments.</summary></entry></feed>
