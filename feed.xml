But one that I encountered, and when I Googled/Bing’d it, I was not able to find any way to do it. I was able to fix it, and you might too, but I thought I should use my blog to share how I solved it, hoping it might come in handy who wants to achieve something similar. If you have alternate or downright better ways to do it, please feel free to add them in comments.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Hello Xamarin (And 2021)</title><link href="https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/01/16/welcome-xamarin" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Hello Xamarin (And 2021)" /><published>2021-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2021-01-16T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2021/01/16/welcome-xamarin</id><author><name></name></author><category term="C#" /><category term="xamarin" /><category term="blog" /><summary type="html">Hey there. So I planned to do this, at least not 15 days later into the year. 2020 has been a mess of an year and eventhough, on the surface, the start might not be awesome, I have better hopes and goals for 2021. One of these goals is to write even more in this blog (considering I’ve written, what like 6 posts in 5 months?). We will see how that pans out in the future, but here is one update that I’d like to share, and the topic you might see future posts on.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Blog Update 1</title><link href="https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2020/12/24/blog-update-1" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Blog Update 1" /><published>2020-12-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2020-12-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://mitesh1612.github.io/blog/2020/12/24/blog-update-1</id><author><name></name></author><category term="fastpages" /><category term="blog" /><category term="about" /><summary type="html">Hey there.
